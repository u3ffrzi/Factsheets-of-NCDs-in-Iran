# Automated National Health Factsheet Generator

## 🏛️ Overview
A data automation system that transformed Iran's STEPS2020 national health survey data into professional factsheets for all 31 provinces. These reports were delivered to the President of Iran and distributed to mayors nationwide as the official health status assessment.

## 💡 The Challenge
Iran's National Non-Communicable Diseases Committee needed to:
- Process complex health survey data for 85 million citizens
- Generate consistent, professional reports for each province
- Create executive summaries for top government officials
- Meet tight deadlines for national policy planning

##  Technical Solution

### Data Pipeline:
STEPS2020 Raw Data → [R Data Processing] → [VBA automated results creation] → [PDF Generation] → Provincial Factsheets

### Key Features:
- **Automated Data Processing**: Cleaned and analyzed survey data for 31 provinces
- **Custom Visualization Engine**: Generated charts and graphs for metabolic/behavioral risk factors
- **Professional Report Design**: Created print-ready PDFs with government branding
